# Prepare for launch! #{-}

With Part II's look at `shapeless.ops`
we have arrived at the end of this guide.
We hope you found it useful for understanding
this fascinating and powerful library,
and wish you all the best
on your future journeys as a type astronaut.

As functional programmers
we value abstraction above all else.
Concepts like functors and monads
arise from years of programming research:
writing code, spotting patterns,
and making abstractions to remove redundancy.
Shapeless raises the bar for abstraction in Scala.
Tools like `Generic` and `LabelledGeneric`
provide an interface for abstracting over data types
that were previously frustratingly unique and distinct.

There have traditionally been two barriers to entry
for aspiring new shapeless users.
The first is the wealth of theoretical knowledge
and implementation detail
required to understand the patterns we need.
Hopefully this guide has helped in this regard.

The second barrier is the fear and uncertainty
surrounding a library that is seen
as "academic" or "advanced".
We can overcome this by sharing knowledge---use cases,
pros and cons, implementation strategies, and so on---to
widen the understanding of this valuable tool.
So please share this book with a friend...
and let's scrap some boilerplate together!
