# Introduction

This book is a guide to using [shapeless][link-shapeless],
a library for *generic programming* in Scala.
Shapeless is large library,
so rather than cover everything it has to offer
we will concentrate on a few compelling use cases
and use them to build a picture
of the tools and patterns available.

Before we start, let's talk about what generic programming is
and why shapeless is so exciting to Scala developers.
